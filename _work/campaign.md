# Byte-matching campaign log

Orchestrator session log. One entry per session; newest first. Resume from git log + this file.

## Session 2026-07-21 (wave 1)

Queue position: **tier 1 (stubs) COMPLETE — stub_zero_size 12 → 0.** Tier 3/4 in progress.

Landed (each its own ratchet-gated commit, baseline locked):
- PlayerEgo::stopBoost, MTitle (2 stubs + 4 fns), Standing, ListItem (+24 linked via
  init()-inlining root-cause fix), BeamGun/SpriteGun (5 stubs), ImageFactory (reload stub + 10 fns),
  MeshMerger (last 3 stubs; memset→__aeabi_memclr idiom, plain-delete for scalar cell free).
- **verify metric v2.1** (91a8ddd0): PIC `ldr rX,[pc]`+`add rX,pc` GOT-delta pool words are now
  always masked. Root cause of phantom linked_exact flips (±2-5) on untouched functions at every
  layout shift — a delta accidentally equal to a function entry was compared as a named function
  pointer. Masking-only: +20 linked recovered at the flip.
- Counts: byte_exact 1115→1116, linked_exact 2125→2190, stubs 12→0, avg 72.33→73.13.

Fleet learnings (apply to future waves):
- Worker prompts must ban `operator new/delete` spelling (goal_lint operator_call is soft-ratcheted
  per file) and hand-declared `__aeabi_*` (mangles to a C++ import → ratchet import-set FAIL).
  Use `memset`/plain `delete` and let clang emit the aeabi calls.
- Workers syntax-check with compile_commands.json + -fsyntax-only; all 7 did this successfully.
- Serial gating flow: split worker edits into per-item patches by file ownership; revert tree;
  apply→ratchet→(--update-baseline + commit)|revert per item. Worked cleanly.
- Root report.json is only synced by the cmake verify target; ratchet.py writes
  cmake-build-match/verify/report.json — `cp` it to root in each commit.
- Wave-1 residual retry queue (unlinked, has fresh bodies now): Standing isEnemy/isFriend/
  getStanding/getMissionBonus; ListItem init/D1/checkCredits/checkSlot/checkSort/copy-ctor;
  MTitle OnKeyPress(50%)/OnKeyRelease(50%)/OnRender2D(64.9); MeshMerger init/setMesh/
  transformMesh/big-ctor/dtor-body; ImageFactory createChar/drawItem family; BeamGun ctor/update.
  MeshMerger::transformMesh: our body is functionally WRONG (2-arg shim passing matrix as vector;
  original iterates positions/normals with a 3-arg MatrixTransformVector form) — needs the real
  3-arg engine call modeled without inventing a new import.
- Shader-zoo near-misses (Init/UpdateMeshData family, 99%+): many were the GOT-delta noise and
  are now linked after v2.1. Remainder differ by one extra literal-pool word (string/TU pooling)
  — TU-membership work (exclusive mode), not per-function fixes.

Next: wave 2 = tier-4 cheap class batches (Ship, FModSound, Wanted+WantedWindow, GameText,
LodMeshMerger, ScrollTouchWindow, BluePrint+Objective) + a retry worker on wave-1 residuals.
Re-triage from fresh report.json first (metric v2.1 moved the near-miss set).
